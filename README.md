# Introduction

This project provides a reference implementation for moving data from on-premises relational database(s) into a Cloud Managed Database Service (Db2 Warehouse on Cloud) so that the data can be analyzed quickly, easily, and without the need to setup any new hardware or request resources from the IT department. In this example, the on-premises databases are in two different RDBMS'es to emulate two different organizations. However, you could use a similar pattern and set of steps to copy from a single database into the cloud as well. 

In this case, one organization is using IBM's PureData System for Analytics (Netezza) and the other Db2 on Linux for their data warehouses. The data from these systems will be pushed into Db2 Warehouse on Cloud so that it can be combined and analyzed as a single entity.  

**We will provide two mechanisms for moving the data from on-premises to the cloud, Bluemix Data Connect and Lift CLI, so that you can choose the method based on who you are demoing to.** Data Connect is a cleaner, easier solution for one time moves, and best used when demoing to Business Users (LOB managers and executives). Lift CLI is how we would productionalize the initial and delta data load process, and best used when demoing to IT.

# Narrative 

Consider the following scenario: You are talking to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at "K Bank". 

In this lab we used the scenario/narrative below, but here is a [video](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloud-data-analytics/blob/master/InternDemoIntro.mov) of one of IBM's Technical Sales Interns presenting the same solution with a couple other ways to look at the data once it is combined to show that this use case can open up so many new opportunities. 

## Lab Narrative

Hi Ms. Smith, I know that "K Bank" just bought "N Bank". I just came from a meeting on how you plan to integrate the two companies’ systems and it is going to take quite a while. I would think that many people, and you in particular, can’t wait for a year or more for the integrated data to start reaching out to your customers.

I know that "K Bank" has been doing churn analytics for some time, but the team at "N Bank" has not. "K Bank" has found that customer loss (churn) is directly related to the customer's satisfaction level. This is kind of obvious, so it would be interesting to see how these churn prediction models could be used to look at "N Bank" customers and identify who might be at risk of leaving. Since "K Bank" just spent a lot of money to acquire "N Bank", you do not want to lose any customers if you can help it.  

IBM can help you combine the data from both banks now, so that you can get access to this combined data within days, without putting any load on your IT staff who is already overloaded with the consolidation.  We can use IBM's fully managed cloud services to copy data from your current on-premises systems in each bank into a cloud data warehouse and give you a single view of your customers across both banks.
 
Once you have that data at your fingertips, you can explore the data and discover how satisfied your customers are, within each Bank and across both Banks. You can also identify which customers are leaving the bank and which ones you should strive to retain.

We can quickly show you how to create a dashboard to showcase your findings, use it to tell a story of what you discovered and the actions you might want to take base on this analysis.

# Solution Overview

The solution is a Business Inteligence (BI) tool that allow Business Users to get quick but important insights from the data. In order to gain this insight the data from both bank systems need to be moved from their data centers into a common repository. Because IT cannot support creating and managing a new system and moving the data, the new, common repository needs to be hosted as a managed cloud service. The BI tools will then be connected to this new repository and the existing analytical reports will be run. 

# Solution Components and Services

There are a few components of this solution. We used a VM to emulate the on-premises systems, PureData System for Analytics (Netezza) and Db2. Both of these systems are commonly used by financial firms due to the performance and security they provide - not only for data at rest, but also data as it is being queried.   

We chose Db2 Warehouse on Cloud as the combined repository since it is a fully managed service in the cloud that can be expanded easily, needs no administration, and has built-in encryption and security. **Note** - Db2 Warehouse on Cloud is ISO 27001, SOC 2, SOC 3 and HIPAA certified. 

Data Connect uses the Secure Gateway to encrypt the data on the wire and Lift uses Aspera to transfer the data using very high levels of compression as well as automatic encryption.   

Cognos Analytics is a modern, self-service Business Intelligence Platform that provides a sleek and intuitive user experience. Cognos Analytics provides the ability to empower everyone in the organization to find insight from their data to positively impact their decision making.

- Netezza Admin = admin / password – You will use these credentials for your Lift data migration


> **Note -** 
>
> Only do step 3A if you are NOT using a QWERTY keyboard layout
>


### Step 3a: Set the Keyboard

**OPTIONAL**  For a non QWERTY keyboard you likely will want to switch to a local keyboard to make the work easier.

[Instructions](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloud-data-analytics/blob/master/UpdateKeyboard.md)


## Login to the Virtual Machine

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-13.png"/>

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-14.png"/>

## Step 4: Update the Secure Gateway ID

> In this section we will be editting some files. If you use **vi** directly in the VM, you cannot cut and paste. If you use the **ssh** command from your laptop into the VM you can cut and paste and eliminate a lot of manual typing complex strings.

<img src="./media/vmimage/SSH1.png"/>

Open a Terminal in Mac/OSX and enter the command **ssh nz@"your VM IP Address"**

When prompted "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?" - Type **yes**

Hit **Enter**

When prompted for the password, enter the password (nz) 

Hit **Enter**


> NOTE - 
>
> In Windows you will need Putty to do this. You can connect Putty to the IP Address in a similar fashion.
> 


<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-18.png"/>

1. **Enter** a command of **cd /etc/ibm**.

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-19.png"/>

2. **Enter** a command of **ls**.

3. **Enter** a command of **vi sgenvironment.conf**.

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-20.png"/>

**Note -** The GATEWAY_ID you will be changing is case sensitve so make sure you type it in exactly as it appears.

4. **Change** the **GATEWAY_ID**, to **GATEWAY_ID="<your_gateway_id>"**. This is your Data Connect service Secure Gateway ID that you were instructed to copy to the clipboard and save off.

5.	**When finished**, hold `SHIFT` and type `ZZ` to save and close the file.

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-21.png"/>

6. **Enter** the command **reboot** to recycle the VM image. This will ensure that the Secure Gateway Client restarts and that it picks up your Gateway ID to communicate with your Data Connect service in the cloud.

**Note -** If you are using Putty to access the VM machine you need to run the commans "su root" to reboot the system.  

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-22.png"/>

7. **Enter** a lowercase login id of **nz** and a password of **nz** to log back into the VM image.

<img src="./media/vmimage/vmimage-image-23.png"/>

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-07.png" >


You are brought to the Cognos Analytics on Cloud home page.


### Create a Data server connection

Before you bein, **Go Back** to your Bluemix account. **Click on** your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service from the service dashboard and go to your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service credentials section that you created in the PreWork section. 


<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-10.png" >


You will need the **jdbcurl**, **username** and **password** from the credentials section of the service to complete the creation of your data server connection in the following steps. Leave this open in your browser so you can copy and paste from it to complete the creation of the data server connection section. 


**Go Back** to the Cogons Analytics on Cloud application in your browser. 


<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-08.png" >


1. **Select** the **Manage** button on the bottom left side of the home page.

2. **Select** the **Data server connections** menu item to create a new data server connection.


<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-09.png" >


3. **Select** the **+ plus sign** to create a new connection.

4. **Select** a type of **dashDB**.  (Note, this is due to change to Db2 Warehouse on Cloud, but has not as of the latest update to this lab.)


<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-11.png" >


**Note -** A Data Server connection name has to be unique across the Cognos Analytics for Cloud shared environment. Therefore, you will use your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud username from your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service credentials plus "Bank Customers" to make the name unique. For instance, my Data Server connection name will be **dash13919 Bank Customers**.


5. **Select** the **edit** icon that looks like a pencil next to the "New data server connection" name. **Enter** a name of **dashXXXX Bank Customers** (your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud username of your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service + Bank Customers) and **click** outside the edit area to save the name.

6. **Copy and Paste** the **jdbcurl** from your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service credentials section into the data connection JDBC URL text box.

> Your JDBC URL will look like this: **jdbc:db2://dashdb-entry-yp-dal09-08.services.dal.bluemix.net:50000/BLUDB**

7. **Select** the **Use the following signon** radio button.

8. **Select** the **+ plus sign** right next to the drop down list box of signons.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-12.png" >

9. **Enter or Copy & Paste** your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud **username** from your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud credentials into the User ID field.

10. **Enter or Copy & Paste** your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud **password** from your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud credentials into the Password field.

11. **Enter or Copy & Paste** your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud **password** from your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud credentials into the Confirm Password field.

12. **Select** the **Test** button to test the connection.

The **Test** should succeeed and you will see a **Success** status with a green check mark next to it. If not, go back and double check your JDBC URL, User ID and password and make sure you entered then correctly and retry the test.

13. **Select** the **Save** button to save your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud data connection. 

Now you will **select** the database schema that you will use in this exercise. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-13.png" >

1. **Select** the **Schemas** tab of your **dashXXXXX Bank Customers** data server connection.

2. **Click on** the **ellipse** ... on the schema that is associated to your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud username.

3. **Select** the **Load metadata** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-14.png" >

When the schema is successfully loaded, the status column next to the schema name will have a green check mark.

### Create a Data Module

With Cognos Analytics, users are not restricted to only using existing enterprise data sources. Users can blend personal data or external data with enterprise data to gain deeper insight. Users can connect to enterprise data directly, or they can import other data sets from from files or other data sources into Cognos Analytics. These data sources can be blended, cleansed and joined together to create a reusable **Data Module** for use in dashboards and reports, and or shared with other users in the organization. Although this lab has only one data source, we will still create a data module.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-15.png" >

1. **Select** the **New** menu from Navigation Bar on the left side

2. **Select** the **Data module** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-16.png" >

3. **Select** the **Data servers** menu from Navigation Bar on the left side

4. **Select** your **dashXXXXX Bank Customers** data server. You will see the schema you created earlier. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-17.png" >

5. **Select** the **Schema** associated with your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service username. For instance, mine is **DASH13919**.

6. **Select** the **Start** button.

**Note -** The recent version of Cognos Analytics now uses a **Done** button instead of Start in some places, so if there is no **Start** button, use the **Done** button instead. 


### Data Modeling

Once a data source is selected, users can enter their desired search term(s) and click on Go to look for tables with data related to that search term. Cognos Analytics will analyze the data source and present table(s) that have some relation to the term you entered that you can add to your data module. Since we want to look into our Bank customers to analyze satisfaction and churn data,  

1. Click on the magnifying glass beside the Data Module panel to open the Intent panel.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-18.png" >

1. In the intent panel, type **Customers**.

2. **Select** the **Go** button.

While we show multiple tables here, you should only see a single table, named **Bank Customers**.

3. **Select** the **Bank Customers** table.

4. **Select** the **Add this proposal** button.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-19.png" >

Your data module should look like the screen shot above.

5. **Select** the **Save** button on the top left corner of the toolbar (looks like a disk).

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-20.png" >

6. **Select** the **My Content** folder.

7. **Enter** a module name of **Bank Customers Module**.

8. **Select** the **Save** button.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-21.png" >

9. **Expand** the **Bank Customers** table in the Data Module View to see all the columns.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-22.png" >

You have told us that your Data Scientists have found some interesting correlations between the number of late payments a customer has had in the past and their propensity to churn. Because this has been identified as an interesting factor for further analysis, we will divide the data into groups based on how many late payments they have had. 

10. **Select** the **ellipse** ... on the **Number of Late Payments** column to view the column menu items.

11. **Select** the **Create data groups** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-23.png" >

We can see that Cognos Analytics suggests creating an equal distribution of the late payment values into 10 groups distributed evenly. However, we will create 3 groups based on the findings of the Data Scientists.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-24.png" >

1. **Change** the Group name to **Group Late Payments**.

2. **Change** the **How many groups?** number from **10 to 3**.

3. **Select** the **Custom** distribution radio button.

4. **Change** the lowest values for the sliders to **1**, **21**, and **3000**

7. **Select** the **Create** button.


<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-25.png" >

The data scientists have also observed a correlation between the number of credit applications a customer has submitted and their tendency to churn. So we will also create a another Custom group for the number of credit applications.

1. **Select** the **ellipse** ... on the **Number of Credit Applications** column to view the column menu items.
2. **Select** the **Create custom groups** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-26.png" >

1. **Change** the Group name to **Group Credit Applications**.

2. **Change** the **How many groups?** number from **10 to 3**.

3. **Select** the **Custom** distribution radio button.

4. **Change** the lowest value to **5**

5. **Change** the middle value to **26**

6. **Change** the highest value to **3000**

7. **Select** the **Create** button.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-27.png" >

8. **Select** the **Save** button on the toolbar to save the data module.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-28.png" >

9. **Go to** the top of the Cognos Analytics user interface and **Click** on the navigation drop down arrow.

10. **Select** the **- minus** sign next to the **Bank Customers Module** entry to close the module.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-29.png" >

11. **Select** the **My Content** menu from the left side main menu.

12. **Select** the **ellipse** ... in the right corner of the **Bank Customers Module**.

13. **Select** the **Open** menu item.

### Create Navigation Group

Navigation groups allow drill downs that align with how users want or need to analyze their business. In this case the Bankid column identifies whether the data is from "K Bank" or "N Bank". 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-30.png" >

1. **Select** the arrow next to the **Bank Customers** table to see the list of columns.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-31.png" >

2. **Scroll down** the list of columns to the **Bankid** column.

3. **Select** the **ellipse** ... on the **Bankid** column to view the column menu items.

4. **Select** the **Create navigation group** menu item.

In our Analysis we want to look at information by Originating Bank, churn, customer type, branch location and customer.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-32.png" >

5. **Rename** the Navigation Group to **Bank Churn**.

6. **Drag and Drop** the **Churn** column below Bankid.

7. **Drag and Drop** the **Customer Type** column below Churn.

8. **Drag and Drop** the **Home Branch State** column below Customer Type.

9. **Drag and Drop** the **Customer** column below Home Branch State.

10. **Select** the **Apply** button.

11. **Select** the **Save** button in the top left corner of the toolbar to save the data module.

## Step 2: Getting Insight

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-33.png" >

1. **Go to** the top of the Cognos Analytics user interface and **Click** on the navigation drop down arrow.

2. **Select** the **Welcome** entry to go back to the Welcome page.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-34.png" >

3. **Go to** the bottom left portion of the Welcome page and **Select** the **+ New** menu.

4. **Select** the **Dashboard** menu item to create a new dashboard.

The Template window then appears, allowing you to select the type of dashboard and the template style. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-35.png" >

5. **Select** the **Tabbed** template.

6. **Select** the **Tabbed layout** on the bottom row with 3 small panels on the top, and 2 full width panels below.

7. **Select** the **OK** button.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-36.png" >

Each panel on the template acts as a placeholder for dashboard objects, known as widgets. Templates are device aware and will auto-size to the screen of the device being used. As we build the dashboard, we will reference the location placement for widgets we create in the dashboard template using the panel numbers as designated and displayed above.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-37.png" >

8. **Select** the **+ plus sign** next to **Selected Sources** to choose a source.

9. **Select** the **My Content** folder.

10. **Select** the **Bank Customers Module** as the source.

11. **Select** the **Open** button.


### Designing a Dashboard

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-38.png" >

Since this is the first dashboard we are creating you can see in the image above that the default name is Tab1.

1. **Click on** the **Tab 1** name. A menu will appear.

2. **Select** the **Edit** menu item that looks like a pencil.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-39.png" >

3. **Enter** a name of **Customer Satisfaction** and then click outside the name are to save the name.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-40.png" >

4. **Select** the triangle next to the **Bank Customers** table name to view the list of columns.

5. **Select** the **Satisfaction** column and **Drag and Drop** it into Panel 1.

> Remember the panel layout from above. Panel 1 is the panel in the top left corner of the template.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-41.png" >

6. **Resize** the **Satisfaction** number to span the entire panel by using the sizing controls.

Here we can see the average satifaction rating for our customers is 3.39 out of 5.

Next we want to look at satisfaction by customer type.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-42.png" >

1. **Select** the **Satisfaction** column

2. **Control-Click** on Windows or **Command-Click** on the Mac and **Select** the **Customer type** column

3. **Drag and Drop** the two columns to Panel 2 on the dashboard.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-43.png" >

4. **Resize** the **Customer Type-Satisfaction** graph to span across panel 1 and 2 by using the sizing controls.

Cognos Analytics gives a visualization to start based on the data types and number of values for the columns selected, but you can change these visualizations by selecting the **Change Visualization** icon. That will show the visualizations that best suit the data types of the columns inside the visualization. You can always select **More** if you do not see a format you like. You can click anywhere else in the dashboard to close this window.

5. **Select** the **Save** button on the toolbar to save the dashboard.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-44.png" >

6. **Select** the **My Content** folder.

7. **Enter** a dashboard name of **Bank Customer Analysis**.

8. **Select** the **Save** button.

> **Note -** If the data source panel is not open, from the Navigation panel on the left side of the screen, select sources to open the data source panel and select the **Bank Customers Module** we were working with.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-45.png" >

1. **Click on** the triangle next to **Navigation paths** to expand it.

2. **Click on** the triangle next to the **Bank Churn** navigation path to expand it.

3. **Click on** the triangle next to **Bank Customers** to expand it.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-46.png" >

4. From the **Bank Churn** navigation path, **Select** the Bankid column.

5. **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** and **Select** the **Satisfaction** column under the **Bank Customers Module**

6. **Drag and Drop** these items to Panel 4 (the panel in the middle of the template).

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-47.png" >

7. **Resize** the **Bankid-Satisfaction** graph to span the entire panel by using the sizing controls.

8. **Select** the **Save** button on the toolbar to save the dashboard.

> **Notice** that there is little difference in the overall satisfaction between the two banks.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-48.png" >

1. From the **Bank Customers** table **Select** the **Satisfaction** column.

2. From the **Bank Customers** table **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** and **Select** the **Age Range** column.

3. From the **Bank Customers** table **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** and **Select** the **Gender** column.

4. **Drag and Drop** these items to Panel 5 (the panel on the bottom of the template).

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-49.png" >

5. **Resize** the **Bankid-Satisfaction** graph to span the entire panel by using the sizing controls.

6. **Select** the **Save** button on the toolbar to save the dashboard.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-50.png" >

7. **Click on** the **Bankid-Satisfaction** graph in Panel 5.

8. **Select** the **Visualization** icon.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-51.png" >

9. **Select** the **Heat Map** visualization from the panel of choices to change the graph to a Heat Map.

10. **Select** the **Arrow** to close the visualization menu.

11. **Select** the **Save** button on the toolbar to save the dashboard. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-52.png" >

Your Dashboard should now like the screen shot above. **Notice** that on average Males are more satisfied than females, and that on the right, our older customers are the least satisfied.

Now, let's add another Tab to the Dashboard.  

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-53.png" >

1. **Select** the **+ plus sign** next to the **Customer Satisfaction** tab to add a new tab.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-54.png" >

2. **Scroll down** and **Select** the 2 x 2 template with 4 rectangles in it.

3. **Select** the **USE** button.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-55.png" >

4. **Select** the **Tab 1** name area. A menu will appear.

5. **Select** the **Edit** icon that looks like a pencil.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-56.png" >

6. **Enter** a name of **Churn Analysis** and click outside the name area to save the name.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-57.png" >

> Note - This image depicts the numbering of the four panels to explain placement in the following steps.

As we said earlier, your data scientists have found that churn seems to be related to the number of credit applications the customer has submitted, and the number of times they have had late payments. Remember we also created groups for late payments and credit applications. Now let's create visualizations for these. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-58.png" >

1. **Scroll** down to the bottom of the list of columns in the **Bank Customers** data module.

2. From the **Bank Customers** data module **Select** the **Group Late Payments**.

3. **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** the **Count** column.

4. **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** the **Churn** column.

5. **Drag and Drop** these columns onto Panel 1.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-59.png" >

6. **Resize** the graph you just created to span and use panel 1 and panel 2 by using the sizing controls.

7. **Select** inside the graph to get a menu of graph actions.

8. **Select** the **Visualization** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-60.png" >

9. **Select** the **Heat Map** visualization to change the graph to a Heat Map.

10. **Select** the **Arrow** in the top left of the visualization menu to close the visualization menu.

11. **Select** the **Save** button in the top left corner of the toolbar to save the dashboard.

> **Note** - Even though we created three groups we see four groups here. What is different?   
>   
> **Notice** that the group on the far right is blank. In this case there were some columns that had no value at all for the number of late payments. In this specific case does this mean that customer had no (ZERO) applications, or that someone forgot to fill in this field, or that there is an application problem somewhere? We need to determine the source of the data and whether it is valid or needs to be fixed. We would need to verify this data with the bank data engineers.

Now you will add a visualization of churn to credit applications. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-61.png" >

1. **Scroll** down to the bottom of the list of columns in the **Bank Customers** data module.

2. From the **Bank Customers** data module **Select** the **Group Credit Applications**.

3. **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** the **Count** column.

4. **Ctrl-Click or Command-Click** the **Churn** column.

5. **Drag and Drop** these columns onto Panel 3.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-62.png" >

6. **Resize** the graph you just created to span and use panel 3 and panel 4 by using the sizing controls.

7. **Select** inside the graph to get a menu of graph actions.

8. **Select** the **Visualization** menu item.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-63.png" >

9. **Select** the **Heat Map** visualization to change the graph to a Heat Map.

10. **Select** the **Arrow** in the top left of the visualization menu to close the visualization menu.

11. **Select** the **Save** button in the top left corner of the toolbar to save the dashboard.

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-64.png" >

> The Churn Analysis tab should look like the screen shot above. From these graphics we can see that our most loyal customers are the ones with the least credit applications and late payments.

> **Note -** We see the same thing in this graphic with some data being (blank). Again, we could assume that a blank is a zero, but for more accurate analysis we should clean up the data and update the blank to a 0 (zero).

Let's go back to the Customer Satisfaction tab, since that was the main reason for the work we have done so far. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-65.png" >

In the middle of the window there are two bars, **K** and **N** (K Bank and N Bank).

1. **Click** on the **Bankid** label between the bars.

2. **Select** the **drill down** button (second from the right).

We now see two bars, yes and no, "yes" means the customer has left the bank and "no" means they have not left the bank. Let’s investigate the customers who have left the bank (yes). We can also see (in the Satisfaction graph in the top left corner) that the satisfaction scores are lower for the yes bar (the people who have left).

3. **Click** on the **yes** bar on the right.

4. **Select** the **drill down** button (second from the right).

We notice that all of the visualizations change to be relative to customers who left, and that the satisfaction score changes to a lower number, which makes sense. We now see that our Small Business customers have the lowest satisfaction scores **3.04**. You can hover over any of the bars in the graph to get more details about the metric. Hover over the **Small Business** bar in the graph and you will see the **3.04** satisfaction score.

We can dig deeper into these customers by drilling down further.

1. **Click** on the **Small Business** bar in the graph.

2. **Select** the **drill down** button (second from the right). 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-70.png" >

This shows the States of the customers who left the bank. In this case since we are filtered on Small Business, we see the satisfaction level of all Small Business customers who have left, by their state. 

To find the state with the lowest satisfaction score:

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-71.png" >

1. **Click** on the **Satisfaction (Average)** axis title on the left hand side of the chart.

2. **Select** the **Sort** button.

3. **Select** the **Sort descending** menu item.

We see that Rhode Island has the lowest satisfaction level. We can drill down to find out which customer(s) from Rhode Island closed their accounts. 

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-74.png" >

1. **Click** on the **Rhode Island** bar in the graph.

2. **Select** the **drill down** button (second from the right).

<img src="./cmedia/ca-image-75.png" >

We see that we had one customer (UX10401) leave us from Rhode Island, and their satisfaction level was 2.  

Additionally, if we look at the bar below, we can see that this customer was a 70 - 79 year old female.

> **Note -** You can click on any part of the dashboard and the rest of the dashboard will filter based on the value you select. Also, we would usually title these graphs, set maximums on graphs, specify different colors, etc. to make the dashboard more appealing before sharing across the enterprise (or at the board meeting). But for the sake of time we will skip that for this demo.
